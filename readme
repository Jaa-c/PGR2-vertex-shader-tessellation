Seminar work on CTU FEE, in course A4M39PGR2 - graphics in openGL.
This project is an implementation of adaptive tessellation on vertex shader, no 
tessellation shader is involved. Tessellation is defined by a tessellation factor 
(factor of n produces n^2 triangles from the original one) and also by maximum 
tessellation distance. The factor is linearly interpolated between camera position 
(maximum factor) and maximum distance (factor 1).
